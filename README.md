# Churn-Modelling-Prediction

## Problem Statement :-
A bank uses these independent variables and analyse the behaviour of customer to see wether they leave the bank or stay. Now the bank has to create a predictive model based on this data set in order to predict the behaviour of new customers. This predictive model has to predict for any new customer wether he or she will stay or leave the bank so that the bank can offer something special for the customer, whom the predictive model predicts that they will leave the bank.
